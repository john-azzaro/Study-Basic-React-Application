Process Notes for Basic React Application
=========================================


About Process Notes
===================
"Process Notes" is a step-by-step workflow document that outlines the "phases" of my app development and the successive steps taken at each
milestone of application development. Groups of related steps are combined into "phase" modules so that they can be reorganized and refined 
in post-review. This has proven to be EXTREMELY helpful in learning (i.e. Feynman technique (https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)) 
and refining workflow so I can improve my process in future projects. It also has come in handy for some tricky bug fixes not only for
past projects, but this one as well so I would urge you to consider at least doing a rough summary for your own benefit.
